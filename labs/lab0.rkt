;;! Problem 1

;; For any word of at least one character that starts with a letter,
;; let’s say that its "bingo word" is the uppercase version of the
;; first letter, followed by a space, and then followed by the number
;; of characters in the word. For example, the bingo word of "bingo"
;; is "B 5" and the bingo word of "Win" is "W 3".
;
;; TODO: Write a function, bingo-word, that takes a string as an argument
;; and returns its bingo word. You may assume that the argument is a valid
;; word as described above.
;
;; Don't forget to include a signature and reasonable purpose statement.


;; bingo-word:string ->
(define (bingo-word word)(string-append (string-upcase(substring word 0 1)) " " (number->string(string-length word))))


;;! Problem 2

;;! Part A

;; TODO: use the triangle, square, rectangle, above, and overlay/align
;; functions to define the image of a HOUSE with a roof and door
;; (and circle if you’re feeling bold enough for a door handle).
;; Be creative :)


(define HOUSE (overlay/offset (circle 10 "solid" "black") 30 -155 (overlay/align "middle" "bottom" (rectangle 100 150 "solid" "medium red") (above (triangle 250 "solid" "red")(square 250 "solid" "medium gray"))
                                                                                 )))





;;! Part B

;; TODO: define a constant WINDOW and place two of them on your humble home,
;; defining HOUSE-WITH-WINDOWS. Note how in using a constant we only have to
;; draw it once and get to use it twice!

(define WINDOW (overlay/align "center" "middle" (rectangle 50 10 "solid" "black")(overlay/align "center" "middle"(rectangle 10 50 "solid" "black")(square 50 "solid" "white"))) )

(define HOUSE-WITH-WINDOWS (overlay/offset WINDOW -50 -25 (overlay/offset WINDOW 50 -25 HOUSE)))
;;! Part C

;; TODO: define a function sky-color which, given the amount of time since the
;; program began, produces the correct color for the sky. Colors in DrRacket can
;; either defined via a name (like "blue" and "red"), or by numbers, representing
;; the amount of red, green, and blue (each a number from 0-255) using the color
;; function (color red-val green-val blue-val).
;;
;; Your function should always use 0's for red and green, but differ in the amount
;; of blue according to the following steps...
;; 1. Divide the time by 510 and take the remainder (using the remainder function);
;;    this allows the sky color to "loop" back to 0 when time gets bigger than 510.
;; 2. Subtract 255 from that result, and then take the absolute value
;;
;; If it helps to see it in math notation...
;; |(t remainder 510) - 255|

;; Here's a link to show how the amount of blue in the color will change over time...
;; https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ntq43wwjpg

;; sky-color : Nat -> Color
;; Cycles the amount of blue in
;; the color from 255 -> 0 -> 255

(define (sky-color time) (color 0 0 (abs (-(modulo time 510) 255))))


;;! Part D

;; TODO: now finally, define a function called scene, which produces a picture of
;; your house (with windows) on top of the sky (given the appropriate color
;; from the last step). THEN uncomment the final line below to see the result :)

(define (scene time) (overlay/align "center" "bottom" HOUSE-WITH-WINDOWS (square 500 "solid" (sky-color time))))

;;(animate scene)
