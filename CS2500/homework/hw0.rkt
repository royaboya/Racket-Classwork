;;! Problem 1

;;! Part A

;; Examine the following function, and:
;; i.   Write down its signature,
;; ii.  Give it an informative purpose statement, and
;; iii. Give the function and its arguments more informative names.

;; [TODO] Signature
;; [TODO] Purpose

;; detective: Number, Number, String -> String
;; Determines if given person is eligible to ride an amusement park ride
;; given the condition that they are greater or less than 48 inches.
;; Riders greater than 48 inches are not permitted to ride. 


(define (detective a b c)
  (if (< (+ (* 12 a) b) 48)
      (string-append "Welcome aboard, " c "!")
      "Sorry, you may not board the ride. :("))

;; [TODO] Better names for detective and its arguments
;; Better function name: amusement-park-ride
;; Argument Suggestions:
;; a - feet
;; b - inches
;; c - name


;;! Part B

;; Write the signature of the following function:

;; [TODO] Signature

;; mystery: string, string, number -> string
(define (mystery x y z)
  (string-append (substring x 0 z)
                 (substring y z)
                 (substring y 0 z)
                 (substring x z)))


;;! Part C

;; Describe the values that mystery produces when you apply it to two identical
;; arguments for x and y.

;; [TODO] Prose description as a comment.

;; the function mystery creates a string with its repeat appended right after.  

;;! Problem 2

;; You and your friend have been arguing about how best to invest some money.
;; You think you've picked some stocks that give decent gains consistently, but
;; your friend really wants to invest in cryptocurrencies, which she believes
;; have substantially larger gains some good days, but also suffer some losses
;; on some bad days. To settle the debate of which to invest in, you offer to
;; program a simulation of the two choices.

;;! Part A

;; Define a function stock-day which simulates a single day of gain from the
;; stocks you have in mind. Specifically, stock-day should receive as its
;; argument the amount of money you have, and should produce the amount you
;; will have after a 4% gain. For example, (stock-day 1000) should produce 1040.
;; In addition, write three examples. Here is one to get you started:
;;
;; (stock-day 1000) ; produces 1040

;; [TODO] Function definition
;; [TODO] Examples

(define (stock-day current-money)(* current-money 1.04))

;;(stock-day 300) ; produces 312
;;(stock-day 1090) ; produces 1133.6
;;(stock-day 16000) ;produces 16640
;;! Part B

;; Define a function crypto-good-day which simulates a single day of gain from
;; cryptocurrencies, assuming it was a good day. Specifically, crypto-good-day
;; should calculate the amount of money you will have after a 10% gain.
;; You must also write three examples of this function.

;; [TODO] Function definition
;; [TODO] Three examples

(define (crypto-good-day current-money)
  (* current-money 1.1))

;;(crypto-good-day 10090) ; produces 11099
;;(crypto-good-day 4000) ; produces 4400
;;(crypto-good-day 480) ; produces 528
;;! Part C

;; Define a function crypto-bad-day which simulates a single day of loss from
;; cryptocurrencies, assuming it was a bad day. Specifically, crypto-bad-day
;; should compute the total amount of money you will have after a â€“2% loss.
;; For example, if you start with $100 in crypto, after a bad day, you will
;; have $98 left. You must also write three examples for this function.

;; [TODO] Function definition
;; [TODO] Three examples

(define(crypto-bad-day current-money) (* current-money 0.98))

;;(crypto-bad-day 105) ; produces 102.9
;;(crypto-bad-day 1600) ; produces 1568
;;(crypto-bad-day 10000) ; produces 9800

;;! Part D

;; Define a constant STOCK-6-DAYS which is the total amount of money you would
;; have after starting with $1000 and repeatedly investing all of it in stocks
;; six days. You must use the stock-day function.
;; Hint: You can use the value produced by stock-day on the first day as the
;; argument for stock-day on the second day, and so on.

;; [TODO] Define the constant
(define STOCK-6-DAYS (stock-day(stock-day(stock-day(stock-day(stock-day(stock-day 1000)))))))


;; Define a constant CRYPTO-6-DAYS which  simulates cryptocurrency trading for
;; 6 days starting with $1,000, alternating crypto-good-day and crypto-bad-day,
;; **starting with crypto-good-day**.

;; [TODO] Define the constant
(define CRYPTO-6-DAYS(crypto-bad-day(crypto-good-day(crypto-bad-day(crypto-good-day(crypto-bad-day(crypto-good-day 1000)))))))

;;! Part E

;; Now compare the results! Which one seems to have done better?

;; [TODO] Write which one seems better? Write it as a comment here.

;; STOCK-6-DAYS seems to have done better as the result of 1265.319018496 is greater than
;; 1252.726552 after running the constants in the console.

;;! Problem 3

;; In western classical music, tones are typically placed on a scale called
;; the twelve-tone scale. We use non-negative integers to refer to each tone.
;; For example 60 refers to the tone called "C" (or the "do" in "do-re-mi")
;; near the middle of a piano, whereas 61 refers to the tone one unit higher.
;; We consider two tones with a gap of a multiple of 12 units between them as
;; equivalent. For example, the tones 0, 60 and 84 are all equivalent: they are
;; all the tone "C". However, tones 60 and 67 are not equivalent.

;;! Part A

;; Define a function called tone-class which consumes a single tone as an
;; argument, and produces its *class*,  which is the smallest non-negative
;; integer that is equivalent to the tone. For example, the class of 60 is 0,
;; the class of 61 is 1, and the class of 0 is 0 itself. You must also write
;; three examples for your function.

;; Hint: Since there are 12 classes starting with zero, you can calculate the
;; class as the remainder. Try looking for relevant functions in the DrRacket
;; Help Desk.

;; [TODO] Function definition
;; [TODO] Three examples

(define (tone-class tone) (modulo tone 12))
;;(tone-class 57) ; produces 9
;;(tone-class 84) ; produces 0
;;(tone-class 14) ; produces 2

;;! Part B

;; The distance between two tones is how far apart they are, while keeping
;; equivalence in mind. Since there are 12 tone classes, the maximum distance
;; between any pair of tones is 12. However, there are two distances you can
;; produce, depending on which tone you consider first:

;; - The distance between tones 60 and 63 is either 3 (counting up) or 9
;;   (counting down).
;; - The distance between 60 and 75 is also either 3 or 9.
;; - The distance between 63 and 70 is 5 or 7.

;; Write a function called tone-distance which consumes two tones as arguments,
;; and produces their distance (either distance), as defined above.
;; Write three examples for tone-distance.

;; [TODO] Function definition
;; [TODO] Thee examples

(define (tone-distance tone-one tone-two) (abs(- (tone-class tone-one) (tone-class tone-two))))
;;(tone-distance 60 75) ; produces 3
;;(tone-distance 35 12) ; produces 11
;;(tone-distance 13 19) ; produces 6

;;! Part C

;; On a piano keyboard, each class of twelve tones (a.k.a., an octave) are
;; placed in a standard pattern of eight white and five black keys. If you are
;; not familiar with this pattern, here is a picture of a piano keyboard:

;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_keyboard#/media/File:Klaviatur-3-en.svg

;; Write a function called keyboard that consumes the height and width
;; of the white keys, and produces an image that looks like a piano octave.
;; The black keys are roughly half the width and about 3/4 the length of the
;; white keys.

;; Note: The picture linked above labels the white keys. Your image does not
;; have to do so.

;; Hint 1: The overlay/align function may be very helpful.

;; Hint 2: You can use "transparent" as a color for a rectangle.

(define (keyboard width height)
  (overlay/offset(rectangle(* 0.25 width)(* 0.75 height) "solid" "black") (+ (* 0.09375 width )(* -4 width)) (* 0.125 height) (overlay/offset(rectangle(* 0.5 width) (* 0.75 height) "solid" "black") (* -2 width) (* 0.125 height) (overlay/offset(rectangle(* 0.5 width)(* 0.75 height) "solid" "black")(* -1 width)(* 0.125 height)(overlay/offset(rectangle(* 0.5 width) (* 0.75 height) "solid" "black") 0 (* 0.125 height)
  (overlay/offset(rectangle(* 0.5 width)(* 0.75 height) "solid" "black") (* 2 width) (* 0.125 height) 
  (overlay/offset(rectangle (* 0.5 width)(* 0.75 height) "solid" "black") (* 3 width)(* 0.125 height)(beside
  (rectangle width height "outline" "black") (rectangle width height "outline" "black")
