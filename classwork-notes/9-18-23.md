## Reducing repetitiveness
- create functions to create shape instances
- replace shape calls (e.g rectangle, circle, etc) with function call
- example names: draw-circle, draw-rectangle, etc
- takes in parameters as arguments too (i.e mode: "outline", "solid", etc)
- make code more readable, easy to write
- if statements can also be used in function parameters for concise code

## Struct Notes
- If you want to modify the values of a struct, well you can't
- Create new struct of same type while also inputting the values by accessing the previous structs' values. 
- Create methods to create new structs with modified values
